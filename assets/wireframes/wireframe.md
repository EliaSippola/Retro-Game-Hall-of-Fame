# about wireframes

about whole experience:
Only using the blue / white / gray theme since other colors don't fit cleanly. The sidebar can have more data on it other than events as well (news, other texts). There is no settings (other than language) in the menu, but there can be added more. After logging in, there should be your username on the right in place of login.

take inspiration from https://retrogamehouse.fi/

## HOF-desktop

All games should have photos. Maybe even a bacground photo under everything. The description will not show in full. Maybe scrollable?

page selector and search to make it easier to move and find games.

## HOF-phone

Same as for desktop. Sidebar moved to bottom, to make space for games.

## GameData-desktop

sidebar will presist. game will show full description. On the side there will be release date, publisher and other cool/necessary details about the game.

Categories if needed

All records will be shown in a list.

Maybe a photo on the backround as well?

## GameData-phone

Same as desktop, but records will be needed to scroll. (maybe possibility to open the record. and no scrolling (?))
